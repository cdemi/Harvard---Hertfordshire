# Microsoft Word Harvard Refercing Template for University of Hertfordshire
This is an implementation of the Harvard reference style based on the description by the [University of Hertfordshire](http://www.herts.ac.uk/).

This is built on Hertfordshire Business School's [Centre for Academic Skills Enhancement (CASE)](http://www.studynet1.herts.ac.uk/go/CASE) comprehensive [Harvard Referencing Guide](http://www.studynet1.herts.ac.uk/ptl/common/asu.nsf/Teaching+Documents?Openview&count=9999&restricttocategory=Harvard+Referencing).

## How to Install
* Make sure Microsoft Word is closed
* Copy the [HarvardHertfordshire.XSL](HarvardHertfordshire.XSL) file to the `%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Bibliography\Style` folder on your PC.
* Open Microsoft Word, go to the References tab and under Style, you may now choose: **Harvard - Hertfordshire**
