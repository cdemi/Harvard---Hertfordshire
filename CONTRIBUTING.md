# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteers to help keep this style updated and fill out any missing styles

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Harvard-Hertfordshire-Word-Reference-Style](https://github.com/cdemi/Harvard-Hertfordshire-Word-Reference-Style/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
